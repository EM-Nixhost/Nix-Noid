This is a very simple "re-distribution" of Nix-OS without flakes, home-manager or anything fancy, just a simple system to utilize the modularity and reproducablitiy of Nix-OS so my friends can try out linux in stability and freedom.
it create a per Host "host" config file and a per user "application" file and uses nix-software center to easliy manage pkgs in said application folder.
